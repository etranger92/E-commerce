This is my first project and I want to raise some points.

 First of all, I would like to stress the point that I am quiet happy with my JS files because I found the code enough clear to understand what is going on. I did try to follow some principles of the book "clean code" such: avoiding comments by choosing names of var and function accordingly to their purposes. 
 But, considering the CSS one, I am not happy with the code. I jumped into css style without planning it. The good point is I learnt from my mistake and now, any websites I want to create I first start to design it in a white page with a pen. It makes my life and my work faster because I have a large vision of what is going on where I did not during this project.
